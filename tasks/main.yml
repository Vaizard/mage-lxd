# This role REQUIRES the lxd snap to keep up with upstream.
# Data and unix-socket paths are hardcoded accordingly.
#
# This role REQUIRES a local installation of LXD (on the machine
# that you run ansible on). If you don't want to or can't use
# the snap here, install lxd manually and skip the 'local' tag.
